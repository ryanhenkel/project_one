** How COVID-19 affected Los Angeles County **

Los Angeles County is home to almost ten million people and houses some of the stateâ€™s richest and poorest neighborhoods. The county faced millions of confirmed COVID cases, and over 36,000 Angelenos lost their lives. Our group wanted to find answers about how the pandemic affected the many different neighborhoods within Los Angeles. We conducted an analysis of the neighborhoods and cities of Los Angeles County COVID-19 case rates and death rates and compared them to median income, population density, and rate of people fully vaccinated. We hypothesized that the data would reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic had a worse effect on lower-income areas.

We created nine graphs and three maps comparing the many different variables to each other. Our analysis found three graphs to be the most statistically significant with the highest correlation, and one map that indicated the strongest relationship. They are: Median Income vs Population Density, Median Income vs. Death Rate, Case Rate vs. Vaccination Rate, and the map that illustrated the death rate in various Los Angeles communities.

Median income and population density proved to have a negative correlation. Meaning that overall, more affluent neighborhoods in Los Angeles are less densely populated. While this doesn't immediately have to do with COVID-19, it ties into our next graph of median income vs. death rate. This graph has a negative correlation which shows that overall, low-income neighborhoods have a higher death rate than high-income neighborhoods. This graph proved our hypothesis to be correct. We believe this is the case for a number of reasons: less access to healthcare, fewer vaccination sites, higher population density, and less ability to take preventative measures against the virus, such as working from home. Our third significant graph revealed the correlation between case rates vs. vaccination rates, proving that areas with a higher percentage of people fully vaccinated had fewer overall COVID cases. The map of COVID death rates in Los Angeles further proves our hypothesis and illustrates that medium and low-income neighborhoods have higher death rates than high-income neighborhoods.

Our project revealed that median income and population density did have an effect on how COVID-19 permeated through the city and county of Los Angeles. Those living in low-income and densely-populated areas were most negatively affected, facing higher death rates than anywhere else in the county. This project highlights how income inequality can affect a city in more ways than one might initially expect.
