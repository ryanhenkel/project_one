# Los Angeles County Income vs. COVID Vaccination Cross Comparison

Team Members:
Ryan Henkel
Jadon Couch
Marla Blanco

Questions we found interesting and what motivated us to answer them:

Our group was interested in two datasets we found regarding neighborhoods in Los Angeles County, one looked at median income levels, and the other at COVID vaccination rates. From there we began asking questions about whether we could find correlation between the two.
	Is there a correlation between income and vaccination rates?
	Is there a correlation between income and death rates?
	Is there a correlation between income and overall COVID case rates?


We also found an API of census data that breaks down population by neighborhood which could be useful in helping us further understand our data.


Data Sets to be used:
*Median Income: https://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/income/median/neighborhood/list/
*Vaccination Rates by Neighborhood: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/vaccination-rates-by-neighborhood
* Census Data: http://www.census.gov/developers/

Additional resources if time permits:
*Crime rate 2020 to present (with lat and long): https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present

Breakdown of Tasks:
Ryan: Analysis,PowerPoint
Jadon: Data cleaning and Jupyter Notebook
Marla: Use matplotlib to create 6 to 8 visualizations of our data with detailed labels and explanation
